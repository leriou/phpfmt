# phpfmt's engine will no longer be bundled with the plugin.

From this release, the plugin will download from the phpfmt website the desired
version of the engine. It means you can pin the formatter engine into a particular
version should you want to.

In the configuration file, two new options have been added:

```
{
	...
	"engine_channel": "lts", // being lts or alpha
	"engine_version": "", // the version number within the channel, such as 803.2 - leave empty to upgrade to the latest always.
	...
}

```
